 * This activity will handle the functionality for changing user account information.

 * From here the user will be able to change their name, username, and password.
 * The user will not be able to change their email as that will be the primary key in the database and must
 * remain unique and unchanged. The user would have to make a new account and delete this account if they wanted
 * to change the email.
 * 
 * Currently for version 1 there will be no support for deleting an account.
